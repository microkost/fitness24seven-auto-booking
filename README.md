# Automatic login for group classes in Fitness24seven

> [!CAUTION]
> This tool is deprecated. Web booking option was removed.

The company introduced changes in the [access system](https://forum.fitness24seven.se/org/fitness24seven-se/d/mobile-access-entry-system/) in late 2023.
[Booking of group classes](https://fi.fitness24seven.com/palvelut/ryhmaliikunta/ryhmaliikuntatunnin-varaus/) was moved to be completely handled by their mobile app.
This technology solution cannot handle the change and it is discontinued from support.
